    <p> I have always been a visual person, my memory is very graphic. You know how sometimes you walk by a bakery, smell the freshly made bread and think
        about your grandma? I feel the same way, but with visual references instead. When I realized the potent effect that a picture had on bringing back
        a memory, I started investing in capturing moments I would later like to relieve. And that's how my journey as an amateur photographer beggins.
